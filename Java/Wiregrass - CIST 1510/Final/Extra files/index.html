		new amounts of hillarious stuff!</p>
		<h3>That Start of Quigley's Crazy Zoo</h3>
		<p>The Quigley Zoo is a medley of pets. We started out with rescuing Snowball from Alaska. At that 
		time we had two other cats and one dog. Over time the two older cats and dog passed away, leaving 
		Snowball alone. When at a pet store, we saw a Sulcata Tortoise that was the size of a silver 
		dollar. What else could we do but take him home? Later, after rescuing a mother cat and her kittens, we 
		were once again filling our home. We found good homes for all of the kittens and the mom except 
		Crush and Morty. Around this time we fell in love with a puppy being given away at Walmart. 
		Here enters Jack. Soon we realized that Jack needed a friend that wasn't a cat, so we rescued 
		Roscoe.</p>
		<h3>What the Pages are for</h3>
		<p>The Home page is used to explain what this website is about and for. The News Feed page will 
		show you the most recent or popular posts from our other social medias. The Bio page goes over all 
		the Quigley pets and gives you some detais about them. The Gallery page is full of photos and 
		videos (Some not shown on Twitter!) for you to go through.The Your Idea page is where you can 
		submit your ideas that you would want to the pets to do; be creative! The Questions page is where 
		you can see common asked questions about the pets and ask us your own!</p>
