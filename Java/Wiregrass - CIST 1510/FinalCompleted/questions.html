		<h3>Common Asked Questions</h3>
		<p id="questions">Are Morty and Crush twins? <a href="#" id="more">Answer</a></p>
			<div id="expand">
				Yes, Crush and Morty are twins. They were actually in a litter of 5 kittens that 
				we addopted from a police station. They would find and take in wild cats.
			</div>
		<p id="questions">What type of dog is Jack? <a href="#" id="moreTwo">Answer</a></p>
			<div id="expandTwo">
				Jack is a mixture of Greyhound and lab. We are not 100% sure becasue we got him 
				from a guy giving away puppies outside of Walmart. We just title him a Heinz 57.
			</div>
		<p id="questions">Where do you get your pets? <a href="#" id="moreThree">Answer</a></p>
			<div id="expandThree">
				All our pets (except Rocky and Squiggles) are rescues. We always rescue and try to 
				pick the pets that might not be picked. Roscoe was at the Humane Society for a 
				long time, and no one was planning on pickig him up. For that reason we chose him 
				since his time there was almost up.
			</div>
		<p id="questions">What do you feed Rocky? <a href="#" id="moreFour">Answer</a></p>
			<div id="expandFour">
				Besides eating as much grass as he wants from the backyard, we feed him lots 
				of vegetables and flowers. The vegetables consists of broccoli, cucumbers, kale, 
				carrots, squash, zucchini, and spinach. The flowers he likes are hibiscus, roses, 
				and sweet potato leaves. Every once in awhile we give him treats that consist of 
				watermellon rinds and pumpkin. 
			</div>
		<p id="questions">How do all the pets react with Rocky? <a href="#" id="moreFive">Answer</a></p>
			<div id="expandFive">
				All the pets get along great with Rocky. They all grew up with him so they are 
				used to him. At times though Jack will forget about him and assume it's a moving 
				rock. He freaks out a bit but then seems to remember.
